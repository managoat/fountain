defmodule Fountain.Conversations.ConversationServerRedactionTest do
  # #315: ConversationServer state holds plaintext tenant secrets, the raw
  # DEK, decrypted BYO inference credentials, the callback API key and the
  # platform Sprites token. Three leak vectors, each covered here:
  #
  #   1. A FunctionClauseError at a callback head embeds the full state in
  #      the exception message — format_status/1 cannot redact an exception
  #      message, so unknown calls/casts must not crash at the head.
  #   2. A crash inside a callback body produces a crash report whose state
  #      field feeds structured handlers (Sentry.LoggerHandler) —
  #      format_status/1 redacts it at the gen_server level.
  #   3. :sys.get_status (ops tooling, remote console) renders state through
  #      the same callback.
  #
  # #1690 covered seven more fields that held plaintext and were not scrubbed:
  # the brokered values, the proxy session, the env credentials, the resolved
  # MCP document, the sandbox command's adapter-owned client, the turn's prompt
  # and reply, and the runner reattach buffer. The field guard at the bottom of
  # this file is the part that stops the next one arriving unnoticed.

  # #1511, each in a change that had no reason to think about crash reports.
  # A name-pattern guard (`cred|token|secret|broker`) would have caught the
  # first two and missed `resolved_mcp_servers`, so this guard works the other
  # way round: every state field is sentinel-filled unless it is named below as
  # legitimately plaintext, and the sentinel must not survive
  # `Redaction.server_state/1`.
  #
  # A new state field is therefore a failing test until its author either
  # redacts it or adds it here with a reason. That is the intended cost.
