defmodule Fountain.Machines.DestroyForcedTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The forced-teardown side of the destroy protocol (ADR 0058 stage 5b).

  Four sites stopped destroying the provider machine and writing the terminal
  row themselves and now ask `Fountain.Machines.Machine.destroy/2` for it:
  `Termination.destroy_home/2` (deleting an agent), `Accounts.Deletion`,
  `SandboxReaper`'s expiry of an abandoned machine, and
  `Termination.reap_sandbox/2`'s dead-server arm.

  What makes them *forced* is one option, and it is the only thing that could
  quietly break all four at once: they pass `terminating_conversation_id: nil`,
  so `Lifecycle.fence_sandbox_for_teardown/2` has no conversation to keep the
  machine *for* and `{:ok, :kept}` is unreachable. Stage 5a's review found the
  opposite mistake — a conversation id handed to a fence that had already
  decided — and what it costs is a machine fenced, live and billing that
  nothing will ever collect. So every site here is driven against both shapes
  the fence would otherwise keep: a persistent home, and a machine a second
  conversation still holds. One bound conversation naming *itself* is the one
  shape the fence does not keep, so a test with a single conversation on the
  machine proves nothing about this and is not the coverage.

  The protocol itself is `destroy_test.exs`; its two post-finalize effects are
  `destroy_effects_test.exs`. This file is about the four callers: what each one
  asks for, what the trail says afterwards, and what each does when the destroy
  is refused — because none of these callers may be stopped by one machine.
