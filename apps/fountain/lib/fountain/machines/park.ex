defmodule Fountain.Machines.Park do
  @moduledoc """
  One park protocol for one machine (ADR 0058, stage 6b; closes #2307).

  A park is the only machine operation with a provider round trip *between*
  the decision and the write, and that is the whole of #2307. Both parks on
  `main` read the row, asked the provider to suspend, and then wrote
  `suspended` — `Fountain.Conversations.Lifecycle.park/4` from a conversation
  server's idle or ceiling tick, `Fountain.Workers.SandboxReaper.idle_sweep/2`
  from the hourly sweep — and neither held anything across the gap. A wake
  landing in it resumed a machine that was about to be suspended, or was
  suspended out from under; #2286 tried to close that with a lock and a
  durable claim, went five adversarial review rounds, and was withdrawn. This
  module is the answer the ADR settled on: a lease, an intent on the row, the
  provider outside every lock, and a compare-and-set finalize.

  `Fountain.Machines.Destroy` is the same shape for the other verb, and where
  the two agree they agree on purpose — the same lease, the same busy wait,
  the same `Conversations.sandbox_status_effects/2` door after the finalize,
  the same "audit after commit, outside every transaction".

  ## The steps

  1. Refuse an enclosing transaction. Provider I/O is never inside a lock or a
     transaction (ADR 0058; #2309).
  2. **Claim a lease** (`Fountain.Machines.Lease.claim/4`) for one operation.
     A lease held by somebody else is waited on, briefly, then refused as
     `{:error, :machine_busy}`.
  3. **Revalidate under the lease** (#2307 constraint 1). A verdict taken
     before the claim is stale by construction, so *every* condition the
     caller decided on is re-read from the locked row and re-applied here:
     the status, the two fences, the provider's capability, whether anybody
     is on the machine, and — for a caller that supplies one — the bound its
     verdict named. Any of them refuses, and the lease is released.
  4. **Stamp the intent**: `transition: "parking"` by compare-and-set on the
     lease epoch, before any provider I/O. `Machines.Machine.busy?/2` already
     refuses a wake, an attach and the rehydrator on a live lease (stage 6a),
     so from here until the finalize nothing starts work on this machine; the
     stamp is what makes an *abandoned* park recognisable to the next owner.
  5. **Checkpoint**, where the machine is a home on a provider that can
     (`Fountain.Conversations.HomeCheckpoint.on_park/2`, ADR 0023, #1073).
     Outside every lock, inside the transition, and best-effort: a failed
     checkpoint is logged and the park goes ahead, because an unparked machine
     keeps billing. Its `provider_meta` write goes through `Lease.cas_update/3`
     under this park's epoch — it is the owner's write, made during the owner's
     own transition.
  6. **Suspend at the provider**, outside every transaction and every lock.
     An error — or a raise, which is the same outcome by 5a's rule — clears the
     transition, releases the lease and answers `{:error, :suspend_failed}`.
     Both callers degrade to a destroy on that, which is the rule ADR 0017
     priced: a park *call* that fails leaves the machine billing, so the cost
     control wins over the agent's memory.
  7. **Finalize**: `status: "suspended"` and the transition cleared, by
     compare-and-set on the same epoch. Zero rows means a newer epoch owns the
     machine — `{:error, :superseded}`, and the taker is the one allowed to say
     what happened to it.
  8. Release the lease. Then the two effects `Conversations.update_sandbox/2`
     would have run (`sandbox_suspended` usage and the queue poke), one
     `sandbox.suspended` audit event, and the co-tenant notice the caller
     supplied.
  9. `{:ok, :parked}`.

  ## Takeover

  A claim that finds `transition: "parking"` on a live row is looking at a park
  whose owner died between step 4 and step 7. Unlike a destroy, this one cannot
  simply be continued: destroying a machine twice is destroying it once, but
  *suspending* one twice is not safe to assume, and — worse — the previous
  owner may have suspended it already, in which case a second suspend and a
  finalize would be right while a resume would be wrong, and nothing on the row
  says which.

  So the taker asks the machine (`Managoat.Sandbox.get/1`) and compensates from
  the answer:

    * `:suspended` — the suspend landed and only the finalize was lost. The
      compensation *is* the finalize: write `suspended`, run the effects, audit.
      `{:ok, :parked}`.
    * `:running` — the suspend had not landed (or, on Sprites, never does
      anything: its suspend is a no-op and the machine scales to zero by
      itself). Clear the transition, leave the row `ready`, `{:ok, :recovered}`.
      The next idle verdict parks it again, through this same protocol, from
      the top.
    * anything else — `:unknown`, `:not_found`, a provider error, a raise —
      reads as running. Clearing a transition is always safe: it returns the
      row to the state every reader already handles, and the machine is
      re-examined on the next pass. Leaving a stale `parking` past one pass is
      the thing that is not safe, which is why there is no fourth branch.

  Never both. The taker resumes nothing: a resume is compute, and #2307
  constraint 5 puts compute behind the account-suspension and credit gates that
  this module does not consult. The salvage branch's compensating resume
  (`follow/2255-reaper-liveness-lock`, round 5) existed because the claim there
  was not a lease and a *successful* suspend could land after the claim was
  taken over; here the finalize is a compare-and-set on the epoch, so a
  superseded owner's suspend changes no row at all and the taker's reading of
  the machine is the only one that writes.

  `SandboxReaper.sweep_abandoned_sandboxes/0` already lists such rows — they
  are `ready`, past a bound, with no live server — so the reaper's own idle
  park is the takeover path, and it happens on the first pass that sees the
  row.

  ## The lease across the provider calls (stage 7a)

  `Fountain.Machines.Renewal` renews this lease at a third of its TTL while the
  checkpoint and the suspend run, so the lease bounds an operation that is
  making progress rather than one that started less than two minutes ago. Until
  7a nothing did, and the 6b review named what that left: a park slower than
  `lease_ttl_ms/0` outlived its own lease, a reaper took the row over and
  cleared the transition while the suspend was still in flight, and the machine
  ended up genuinely suspended behind a row that said `ready`, with no
  `sandbox_suspended` usage row and no audit event, until some later pass
  noticed. The compare-and-set always made that *safe*; it did not make it
  *complete*.

  A renewal that answers `{:error, :lost}` is a takeover that has already
  happened, and the park stops there rather than calling the provider again or
  finalizing: `{:error, :superseded}`, the same word the finalize's own
  compare-and-set would have produced a round trip later.

  The other half of that review note — `Wake.probe_sandbox/4` reusing a machine
  on any `{:ok, _info}` without reading its status, which on E2B and Daytona
  means reusing one that is actually stopped — closed in 7a as well:
  `Fountain.Machines.Resume` reads the status and brings such a machine up.

  ## Outcomes

  `{:ok, :parked}` parked the machine. `{:ok, :already_parked}` is a row that
  was already `suspended` — somebody else's park, or this one superseded after
  its provider call. `{:ok, :already_terminal}` is a row that had stopped.
  `{:ok, :recovered}` is the takeover above finding the machine still running:
  nothing was parked, and nothing is wrong.

  The `{:error, _}` shapes are the *protocol's* vocabulary — `:machine_busy`
  (the lease), `:machine_occupied` (somebody is on the machine), `:fenced`,
  `:cannot_park`, `:not_expired`, `:suspend_failed`, `:superseded`, and
  whatever `Lease` hands back. They are precise on purpose and they are not the
  vocabulary the rest of the system speaks: `Fountain.Machines.Machine.park/2`
  is the door and translates them.

  Step 1's transaction guard is process-local, so with the gate on it cannot
  fire here — the protocol runs in the owner, which is never inside the
  caller's transaction. `Machine.park/2` checks before it dispatches, for the
  same reason `destroy/2` does.

  #
  # **The third depends on whom the caller speaks for**, and the two policies
  # here are the two that exist on `main`, kept apart on purpose.
  #
  #   * A caller with a `requesting_conversation_id` is a conversation server
  #     bound to this machine, and its question is ADR 0023 step 5's: is any
  #     *other* conversation active inside the idle window? A co-tenant whose
  #     server is live but idle is not activity — that is the whole reason
  #     `notify` exists, and refusing on it would mean two idle conversations
  #     on one home could never park it, each vetoing the other, until both
  #     servers died and the reaper did it. The busiest production machine
  #     carries 36 (ADR 0023).
  #   * A caller with none is a sweep, acting on nobody's behalf, and *any*
  #     live `ConversationServer` refuses it. That is the reaper's rule
  #     unchanged: its idle pass exists for machines with nothing watching
  #     them, and a machine with a server has one enforcing its own bounds.

  # A turn running on the machine, and whose turn counts.

  # For every caller but one, any turn anywhere: the idle bound's whole premise
  # is that nothing is running, so a turn found here means the verdict was
  # wrong, and the reaper's sweep is for machines nobody is using at all.
  #
  # **The max-lifetime ceiling is the exception, and it is the case the ceiling
  # exists for.** `Lifecycle.check/4` lets `{:expired, :max_lifetime}` through
  # with `busy?` true on purpose — the absolute bound is there for the
  # conversation that never stops being busy — so a server reaching this with
  # its own turn in flight is the normal way the ceiling fires, not a race. Its
  # own turn is what the park is cutting (`Lifecycle.explain(:max_lifetime,
  # :suspend)` says so to the user: "a turn in flight was cut"), and treating
  # it as a veto made the ceiling unable to park a home at all: the server had
  # already dropped its adapter by then, so the turn it left `running` had
  # nothing to end it, the server stayed up, and the machine went on billing
  # while the ceiling re-fired every minute. `main` parked, stopped the server,
  # and let `terminate/2` orphan the turn — which is what this restores.
  #
  # Another conversation's running turn still refuses. This conversation's
  # clock reaching a ceiling is not a reason to cut somebody else's work on the
  # same machine, and `main` never had to decide that because it did not ask.
  # **And a turn nothing is driving is not occupancy.** A `running` turn row
  # whose conversation has no live `ConversationServer` is a leftover, and one
  # shape of it never goes away on its own: a turn parked on a human's
  # permission decision, whose server then died. `AutonomousTurnReaper` skips
  # those by design — a person may still answer — so the row stays `running`
  # for ever, and counting it refused the park for ever with it. `main` had no
  # turn check at all and its reaper reclaimed that machine; a stage that says
  # it does not change reclamation must not strand it.
  #
  # That closes the strand for the **reaper**, which is where it was stranded:
  # a machine with no live server anywhere is parked whatever its leftover turn
  # rows say. It does not close it for a *server* whose own turn is parked on a
  # permission nobody answers — that server never asks for an idle park at all,
  # because `Lifecycle.check/4` suppresses the idle verdict while
  # `current_turn` is set. That is `main`'s behaviour unchanged, and it means
  # such a machine is reclaimed by the ceiling and by nothing else, so
  # `SANDBOX_MAX_LIFETIME_HOURS` — off by default — is its only backstop. The
  # real answer is a deadline on an unanswered permission, which is neither
  # this stage's nor this module's.

  between. That is #2307 constraint 1 in the shape it was first found in, and
  the salvage branch's "admission wins the lock" cases are about exactly it.

  A conversation server decides on its own tick and asks in the same breath,
  and what could invalidate that decision in between — a co-tenant starting a
  turn, a wake registering a server — is the liveness half above, which it gets
  unconditionally. Re-deriving its verdict here from the machine-wide fold
  would also be a different question from the one it asked: its own
  `last_activity_at` moves on requests that insert no turn row.

  When a verdict *is* supplied, the recheck asks whether the machine is still
  past **some** bound, not the same one. A reaper that decided `:max_lifetime`
  on a row now merely idle still parks it — the machine is expired either way,
  and `transition_reason` records what the caller decided. What it refuses is a
  machine that is past nothing at all, which is what a wake landing between the
  scan and the claim leaves behind.

  # alone, and Sprites' `suspend/1` is a no-op — the sprite scales to zero by
  # itself — so on `main` the checkpoint was *also* taken of a running machine.
  #
  # The one real difference is on the failure path, and it is this order's
  # cost: a suspend that fails after a checkpoint has been taken spends a
  # checkpoint on a machine that stays up, where `main` would have taken none.
