defmodule Fountain.Conversations.ConversationServerTest do
  @moduledoc """
  First tests for `ConversationServer`.

  1,183 lines that provision sandboxes, hold decrypted tenant secrets, mint API
  keys and spend money on sprites — with no test file at all since launch, and
  excluded from the coverage gate on top of that. Every caller `Mimic.copy`'d it
  away, so the module was verified only by running the product.

  These cover the lifecycle: provisioning succeeds and the sandbox reaches
  `ready`; each way provisioning can fail leaves the sandbox and conversation
  marked `failed` rather than stuck; teardown revokes the sprite's callback key;
  and a terminate against a dead server still cleans up the rows.
