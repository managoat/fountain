defmodule Fountain.Machines.Occupancy do
  @moduledoc """
  Who is on one machine: the single answer to "is anyone here" (ADR 0058,
  #2255 decision 1).

  Four unrelated predicates used to answer that question, each with its own
  query and its own idea of what counts — `Conversations._unsafe_sandbox_busy_elsewhere?/4`,
  `Lifecycle._unsafe_sandbox_held_by_other?/2` (`Machines.Binding.held_by_other?/2`
  since stage 8b), `Lifecycle.live_conversation_ids/1`
  and `Lifecycle.any_server_alive?/1`. They all delegate here now. The
  differences between them were deliberate, so this module keeps every one of
  them rather than flattening them into a single boolean; what is shared is
  the reading of the rows and the registry, not the verdict taken from it.

  Nothing here holds a process or writes anything. `Fountain.Machines.Machine`
  serves this struct over a `GenServer.call`, so a later stage can put writes
  behind the same door; the functions themselves stay callable directly, which
  is what keeps the gate-off path identical to today's behaviour.

  ## Loading

  The three constructors cost different amounts, and each caller takes the
  cheapest one that answers its question:

    * `from_preloaded/1` — no query at all. For a `%Sandbox{}` whose
      `conversations` are already loaded, which is what the reaper's scans and
      the reap target both carry. Fills `bound` and `live`.
    * `bindings/1` — one query. Fills `bound` only; the registry is not
      consulted, because the caller that needs this (the teardown fence) asks
      inside a transaction under the sandbox advisory lock and only wants to
      know who holds the row.
    * `load/1` — three queries (two with the sandbox row in hand). The whole
      answer, including turns and last activity. This is what
      `Machine.who_is_here/1` returns.

  A field a constructor did not fill is `:unloaded`, and the function that
  needs it raises rather than quietly answering from a blank. The alternative
  — defaulting to `[]` or `nil` — would turn "nobody asked for this" into
  "nobody is here", which is the exact mistake this module exists to stop
  being possible in four places at once.

  `busy_elsewhere?/4` additionally takes a **sandbox id** in place of a
  struct, and then runs the two short-circuiting `EXISTS` probes the predicate
  has always run rather than loading the machine. Its caller is the
  conversation server's lifecycle tick; see the function's own doc for why
  that path does not pay for the full reading.

  ## `live` is not a subset of `bound`

  `bound` excludes `terminated` and `failed` conversations. `live` does not:
  it is every conversation on the machine with a registered
  `ConversationServer`, whatever its row says. That asymmetry is today's
  behaviour, and it is load-bearing in both directions — the reaper treats a
  registered server as "provisioning is still in flight somewhere in the
  cluster, do not touch this row" regardless of status, while
  `Termination.reap_sandbox/1` terminates through a live server precisely
  because that is what stopping a runaway agent means. Whether an owner should
  keep the distinction is a stage 5/8 question; this stage preserves it.

  What `Conversations._unsafe_sandbox_busy_elsewhere?/4` answers. A server
  that finds its own conversation idle asks it before parking the machine
  everyone is on: the idle verdict is the machine's, taken over the union of
  its conversations' activity (ADR 0023 step 5), not one conversation's clock.
  Activity is a co-tenant's newest turn row (start or end), falling back to
  the conversation's own `updated_at` for one that never took a turn. `nil`
  idle seconds — the bound is off — is never busy.

  ## Two costs, one answer

  Given a **sandbox id**, this asks the two short-circuiting `EXISTS` probes
  the predicate has always run: one query for the co-tenants, then a turn
  probe scoped to them that stops at the first matching row, and a second one
  only if the first found nothing. Given a **loaded struct**, it answers from
  the reading already in hand and runs no query at all.

  The by-id form is the one on the hot path. `Lifecycle.busy_elsewhere?/2`
  asks it from the conversation server's lifecycle tick, once per server, and
  the busiest production home carries 36 conversations (ADR 0023) — so a
  `GROUP BY` over every turn of every conversation on the machine, plus the
  sandbox row that only `last_activity_at` reads, is 38 queries' worth of work
  per tick to answer a question two `EXISTS` short-circuit. `load/1` stays the
  fuller reading for `Machine.who_is_here/1`, which wants the whole struct
  anyway.

  The two forms must agree, and `occupancy_test.exs` pins that differentially
  against the pre-ADR-0058 query on every edge the semantics have: a `nil`
  `ended_at`, a timestamp exactly on the cutoff, the disjunction split across
  two turn rows, a terminated co-tenant holding a `running` row.
