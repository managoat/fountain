# async: false — the one test here rewrites the global `:sandboxes` config,
# and `Quotas.check_fleet_ceiling/1` reads it on every sandbox reservation in
# the suite.
#
# It used to sit in `quotas_test.exs`, which is `async: true`. While it held
# the ceiling at 2, every async test running beside it saw a ceiling of 2, and
# any of them that reserved a sandbox with two already live got
# `{:error, :fleet_full}` instead of what it asserted. That surfaced as
# `conversations_start_test.exs` failing on the tenant-cap assertions — a
# different one each time, on some seeds and not others, and never locally,
# because CI runs the partition under `--cover` and the timing decides who is
# in the window.
#
# ExUnit runs every async module first and the sync ones one at a time
# afterwards, so a sync module cannot overlap an async one. That is the whole
# fix. Keep this module sync, and keep global-config tests out of
# `quotas_test.exs`.
