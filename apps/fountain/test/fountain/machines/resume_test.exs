defmodule Fountain.Machines.ResumeTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The one resume protocol (ADR 0058 stage 7a).

  What these pin is the *order* — the lease, the recheck under it, the
  admission, the intent, the provider, the finalize, the trail — and what each
  step does when the world moved under it. `Park`'s suite is the sibling; the
  two differ in exactly one place, and it is the reason this file exists: a
  resume turns a parked disk back into compute, so it has to pass the quota
  gate, and where that gate runs is the whole of 7a.

  The wake path keeps its own suites (`conversations_wake_test.exs`,
  `wake_policy_test.exs`, `wake_race_test.exs`); this file is the protocol on
  its own.

  `async: false`: the gate is application environment, and the gate-on cases run
  the protocol inside an owner process that needs the shared sandbox connection.
