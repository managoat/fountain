defmodule Fountain.Machines.Resume do
  @moduledoc """
  One resume protocol for one machine (ADR 0058, stage 7a).

  ADR 0023 step 4 asked for a per-sandbox owner so that "two prompts waking one
  machine resume it once; the second waits". On `main` they do not. Two wakes of
  one parked home both read `suspended`, both call `Managoat.Sandbox.resume/1`,
  and both write `ready`; what serializes them is an accident — the *per-user*
  advisory lock `Fountain.Quotas.with_sandbox_reservation/3` takes, which
  happens to be held across the provider call. That accident is also the bug it
  is paying for: the provider round trip runs **inside a database transaction**,
  which ADR 0058 forbids outright and #2309 priced, and it serializes every
  resume a tenant makes rather than every resume of one machine.

  This module is the same shape as `Fountain.Machines.Park` and
  `Fountain.Machines.Destroy` — a lease, a recheck under it, an intent on the
  row, the provider outside every lock, a compare-and-set finalize — with one
  thing neither of them has: an **admission** step, because a resume is the only
  verb here that turns a parked disk back into compute somebody is billed for.

  ## The quota, and why it is where it is

  What the reservation actually protects is two concurrent starts *or wakes* of
  **different** machines both reading "there is room" and both provisioning:
  the fleet ceiling, the tenant's concurrency cap, and the credit gate in front
  of both. What it does **not** need to protect is one machine against itself —
  that is the lease's job, and it does it per machine instead of per tenant.

  So the two are separated, and the ordering is the whole of 7a:

      claim the lease (4316, one short transaction, released at its commit)
      revalidate under the lease
      admit + reserve   (4315, one short transaction, ENDS HERE)
      ── no lock, no transaction, no advisory lock held from here ──
      provider resume, under a renewed lease
      compare-and-set finalize

  The admission is one transaction that takes the quota locks, runs the three
  checks, and — in the *same* transaction — stamps `transition: "resuming"` on
  the row by compare-and-set. That stamp is the reservation. Without it the
  checks would be a read with no record: machine A passes, machine B passes
  while A is still `suspended` and therefore still uncounted, and both wake past
  a cap that had room for one. `Fountain.Quotas.active_sandboxes/0` counts a
  `resuming` row **whose lease is live**, so a machine on its way up holds a slot
  from the instant it is admitted until it is `ready` and counted in its own
  right — and an *abandoned* resume stops holding one when its lease lapses,
  which is the same rule stage 6a set for every other reading of an abandoned
  operation.

  **The two locks are never held at once, in either order.** 4316 is a
  transaction-scoped advisory lock inside `Lease.claim/4`'s own short
  transaction and is gone before this returns; the lease that outlives it is a
  row, not a lock. 4315 is taken by the admission, after the claim has
  committed, and released at the admission's commit. So the deadlock #2309
  warned about — two namespaces taken in opposite orders — has no site here, and
  `resume_test.exs` proves it with `pg_blocking_pids`.

  ## The steps

  0. **Answer a machine that is already up from one read**, without a lease. A
     prompt to a running machine is the common case and needs nothing done to
     it; see `up_already?/2` for the five conditions that fall through instead.
  1. Refuse an enclosing transaction (#2309).
  2. **Claim a lease** for one operation. Held by somebody else: waited on
     briefly, then `{:error, :machine_busy}`. This is what makes two wakes of one
     machine resume it once — the second waits, and then finds `ready`.
  3. **Revalidate under the lease** (#2307 constraint 1): terminal, either
     fence, the status.
  4. **Admit and reserve**, above.
  5. **Resume at the provider**, outside every lock and transaction, under a
     lease `Fountain.Machines.Renewal` renews underneath it. An error — or a
     raise, 5a's rule — clears the transition and answers
     `{:error, :resume_failed}`, leaving the row `suspended`: the parked disk
     is the agent's memory, and a row marked `ready` over a still-parked
     machine would strand it. That is `main`'s rule, kept.
  6. **Finalize** `status: "ready"`, transition cleared, by compare-and-set on
     the same epoch — and `last_resumed_at` **only where the row was
     `suspended`**. See `finalize/3`: restamping it restarts the max-lifetime
     ceiling's clock, and a machine the provider stopped under a `ready` row is
     not one Fountain parked.
  7. Release. Then the effects `Conversations.update_sandbox/2` would have run —
     one `sandbox_resumed` usage row — and, on the same condition, one
     `sandbox.resumed` audit event.
  8. `{:ok, :resumed}`.

  ## Takeover

  A claim that finds `transition: "resuming"` on a live row is looking at a
  resume whose owner died between steps 4 and 6. As with a park, the row does
  not say whether the provider call landed, so the taker asks the machine
  (`Managoat.Sandbox.get/1`) and compensates from the answer:

    * `:running` — the resume landed and only the finalize was lost. The
      compensation *is* the finalize: write `ready`, run the effects, audit.
      `{:ok, :resumed}`. No second provider call, and no second admission: the
      dead owner paid for this one when it stamped.
    * `:suspended` — the resume had not landed. Clear the transition, leave the
      row `suspended`, `{:ok, :recovered}`. The next wake resumes it through
      this protocol from the top, admission and all.
    * anything else — `:unknown`, `:not_found`, a provider error, a raise —
      reads as suspended. Clearing a transition is always the write that claims
      least, and `suspended` is the state the row was already in.

  **A takeover never resumes**, which is the same rule `Park`'s takeover
  follows and for the stronger reason: a resume is compute, and #2307
  constraint 5 puts compute behind the account-suspension and credit gates. The
  taker holds no admission of its own, so it may finish an operation that was
  admitted and it may not start one that was not.

  **This takeover is the only thing that clears a stale `resuming` stamp**, and
  the residual is worth naming rather than leaving to be found. A stamp whose
  lease has expired is invisible to everything else: `Machine.busy?/2` ignores it
  by 6a's design, `Quotas.active_sandboxes/0` stops counting it the moment the
  lease lapses, and neither reaper sweep looks at `suspended` rows at all — they
  scan `ready`. So a machine nobody ever wakes again keeps the stamp, which costs
  exactly one thing: the admin table renders it as `resuming (abandoned)`. It
  blocks nothing. `Machines.Destroy` falls straight through a foreign transition
  to its fence, and `Conversations.register_server/2` clears a lease-less stamp
  on its way past, so the two paths that would otherwise care are already
  covered. Widening a sweep to `suspended` rows would change what reclamation
  looks at, which is not this stage's to change.

  ## Outcomes

  `{:ok, :resumed}` brought the machine up. `{:ok, :already_up}` is a row that
  was already `ready` — somebody else's resume, or this one superseded after its
  provider call. `{:ok, :already_terminal}` is a row that had stopped.
  `{:ok, :recovered}` is the takeover above finding the machine still parked:
  nothing was resumed, and nothing is wrong.

  The `{:error, _}` shapes are the *protocol's* vocabulary — `:machine_busy`,
  `:fenced`, `:provisioning`, `:resume_failed`, `:superseded`, the admission's
  own refusals, and whatever `Lease` hands back.
  `Fountain.Machines.Machine.ensure_up/2` is the door and translates them.

  # A row that was already `ready` is the `observed: :suspended` path — the
  # provider says the machine is not running and Fountain never parked it — and
  # it gets **none of them**. The reason is `Lifecycle.clock_start/1`:
  # `last_resumed_at || inserted_at` is what the max-lifetime ceiling measures a
  # continuous run from, so restamping here would restart that clock on a
  # machine nobody parked. On Sprites, the instance default, that is not an edge
  # case but the *ordinary* reading — its `suspend/1` is a no-op and its `get/1`
  # reports the platform's own scale-to-zero schedule, so every sprite that has
  # scaled to zero by itself comes through here — and a ten-hour ceiling would
  # have been pushed ten hours out by a probe. `docs/guides/operate/sandbox-lifetime.md`
  # promises the opposite in as many words.
  #
  # Nothing to audit there either: no state changed, and a `sandbox.resumed` in
  # a tenant's trail for a machine that was never suspended describes something
