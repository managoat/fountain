  @moduledoc """
  The one park protocol (ADR 0058 stage 6b; closes #2307).

  What these pin is the *order* — the lease, the recheck under it, the intent,
  the checkpoint, the provider, the finalize, the trail — and what each step
  does when the world moved under it. The two call sites keep their own suites
  (`lifecycle_actions_test.exs`, `conversation_server_lifetime_test.exs`,
  `sandbox_reaper_test.exs`, `sandbox_reaper_park_test.exs`); this file is the
  protocol on its own.

  `async: false`: the gate is application environment, and the gate-on cases
  run the protocol inside an owner process that needs the shared sandbox
  connection.
