# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.7
#
# Phoenix release image for Managoat (umbrella). Build stage compiles
# the `fountain_server` release against Erlang/OTP 28 + Elixir 1.19;
# runtime stage copies the release onto a slim Debian base.
#
# Notes:
#   - Umbrella: COPY apps/, config/, and the root mix.exs/mix.lock.
#     Release definition lives in the umbrella root (releases/0 in
#     mix.exs).
#   - No assets pipeline today: apps/fountain has no `assets/` dir and
#     no `mix assets.deploy` alias. If/when Tailwind+esbuild land,
#     add a `mix assets.deploy` step before `mix release`.
#   - SECRET_KEY_BASE is provided via the Infisical-materialized
#     fountain-secrets Secret (deployment.yaml envFrom). No fallback
#     generation here — fail-fast at boot if it's missing rather than
#     silently invalidate cookie sessions on every restart.

# Umbrella deps live at the root. Copy ONLY what dependency resolution
# reads — the root mix files, config, and each app's mix.exs — before
# fetching and compiling deps, so the (expensive, slow-moving) deps layer
# survives any change to application code. Copying apps/ wholesale here
# is what used to force a full dep recompile on every commit.
#
# coverage.exs is part of that set, not test-only config: both mix.exs
# files read it with Code.eval_file to build `test_coverage`, which runs
# while Mix loads the project — before any task, in every MIX_ENV. Leave
# it out and `mix deps.get` dies on Code.LoadError (#620 moved the
# settings into this file and the prod image stopped building).

# Nothing from docs/: the manual is a static build in site/, not part of the
# server (decisions/0081). `Fountain.FirstRequest` reads the one copy of the
# first request at compile time from apps/fountain/priv/first_request/, which
# the line above carries; `first_request_test.exs` pins that.
#
# rel/ is what `mix release` adds to the stock release: the overlays
# (bin/server, bin/migrate). Mix reads them from rel/ when it is there and
# skips them without a word when it is not, so this line is the whole
# difference.
COPY rel ./rel

# `mix release` also fetches the pinned ACP adapter bundles from their GitHub
# release tags and verifies each against the compiled SHA-512 (the release's
# extra step in the root mix.exs, #2970), so this step needs outbound HTTPS
# and adds about 9.5 MB to the image.

# already-applied versions) and serialized by a Postgres advisory lock, so
# safe under rolling updates; the readiness probe gates traffic until
# migrate + start completes.
#
# MIGRATE_ON_BOOT=false turns this into a plain start, for a deployment that
# runs `bin/migrate` once in a Job instead (#610). `bin/migrate` ignores the
# switch — it is the Job's entrypoint.
