defmodule Fountain.Machines.AdmissionTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The turn-admission protocol (ADR 0058 stage 8a).

  What these pin is what the owner decides **under the lock** that `main` did
  not: a live lease refuses the turn, either fence refuses it, and capacity is
  the runtime's. The per-runtime count itself has its cases in
  `shared_sandbox_test.exs`, beside the context write they exercise; this file
  is the protocol, the two doors, the fence they share, and the one race the
  whole ADR exists for — an admission and a park of the same machine, on real
  connections, in both orders (the #2286 shape).

  `async: false`: the gate is application environment, the gate-on cases run
  the protocol inside an owner process that needs the shared sandbox
  connection, and the race cases use `unboxed_run`.
