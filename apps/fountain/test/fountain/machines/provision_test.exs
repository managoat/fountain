defmodule Fountain.Machines.ProvisionTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The one provision protocol (ADR 0058 stage 7b).

  What these pin is the *order* — the lease, the recheck under it, the intent,
  the discard, the create, `starting`, the caller's pipeline, the finalize, the
  trail — and what each step does when the world moved under it. `Destroy`,
  `Park` and `Resume` are the siblings; this one differs in the shape that made
  it a bracket rather than a move: the work in the middle is the *caller's*, and
  the protocol is what happens on either side of it.

  Three doors come through here, because they are three verbs of one module:
  `run/3` builds a machine, `confirm_up/2` takes possession of one that already
  exists, and `fail/2` retires one whose provisioning is not going to happen.

  The call sites keep their own suites — `conversation_server_provision_*`,
  `conversation_server_reprovision_test.exs`, `conversation_server_broker_test.exs`,
  `initial_start_failure_test.exs`, `conversations_wake_test.exs` — and this file
  is the protocol on its own.

  `async: false`: the gate is application environment, and the cases that drive
  it need the shared sandbox connection.
